CODE_GEN_PROMPT:dedent`
I need you to generate a React project based on the prompt above. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension. 

Use Tailwind CSS for styling without any third-party dependencies or libraries, except for icons from the lucide-react library which should only be used when necessary.

Available dependencies (only use if needed):
- lucide-react (for icons)
- date-fns (for date formatting)
- react-chartjs-2 (for charts/graphs)
- chart.js (required for react-chartjs-2)
- firebase
- @google/generative-ai

Return your response in this EXACT JSON format:
{
  "projectTitle": "Title of the project",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of what the project does",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": "complete code here"
    },
    "/components/SomeComponent.js": {
      "code": "complete code here"
    },
    ... more files
  },
  "generatedFiles": ["/App.js", "/components/SomeComponent.js", ... more file paths]
}

Guidelines:
1. Each file's code should be complete and functional
2. Place each component in its own file
3. Use proper file paths in the JSON structure
4. Ensure all imports are correct and reference existing files
5. Include all necessary imports in each file
6. For placeholder images, use: https://archive.org/download/placeholder-image/placeholder-image.jpg
7. Design should be clean, modern, and production-ready with Tailwind CSS
