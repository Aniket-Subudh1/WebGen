CODE_GEN_PROMPT: dedent`
I need you to generate a modern React project based on the prompt above. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension.

Use Tailwind CSS for responsive styling and clean layouts. The project should be compatible with a Sandpack environment which has LIMITED dependency support.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON DEPENDENCIES:
The Sandpack environment can only use these dependencies:
- react (pre-installed)
- react-dom (pre-installed)
- tailwindcss (via CDN)
- lucide-react (for icons)

DO NOT use these libraries as they are NOT available in the Sandpack environment:
- framer-motion
- gsap
- zustand
- react-spring
- other animation libraries

Instead, use:
- CSS animations and transitions
- CSS keyframes
- Tailwind CSS animation classes
- React's built-in useState and useEffect for simple animations

IMPORTANT: Return your response in this EXACT JSON format:
{
  "projectTitle": "Title of the project",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of what the project does",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": "complete code here"
    },
    "/components/SomeComponent.js": {
      "code": "complete code here"
    },
    ... more files
  },
  "generatedFiles": ["/App.js", "/components/SomeComponent.js", ... more file paths]
}

Guidelines:
1. Each file's code must be complete and functional
2. Place each component in its own file with proper imports
3. Do NOT import any libraries not mentioned in the dependencies list
4. Use CSS animations and transitions instead of animation libraries
5. Add responsive design with Tailwind CSS
6. Use proper naming conventions and organize files logically
7. For placeholder images, use: https://archive.org/download/placeholder-image/placeholder-image.jpg
8. Design should be clean, modern, and production-ready with Tailwind CSS
9. Include App.js and necessary CSS files
10. Ensure the JSON is properly formatted and can be parsed
